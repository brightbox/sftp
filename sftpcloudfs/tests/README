To run the tests you'll need access to an Openstack Swift server.

Set these environment variables before running the tests

  export OS_API_USER='user'
  export OS_API_KEY='key'
  export OS_AUTH_URL='https://url.of.auth.server/v1.0'

Those tests were based on python-ftp-cloudfs tests, MIT licensed.
